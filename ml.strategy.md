## Bias and variance

High bias: training accuracy lower than baseline.

Solution:
* Bigger network
* Longer training
* Redesign NN architecture

High variance: overfitting, test accuracy << training accuracy

Solution:
* More data
* Regularization
* Longer training
* Redesign NN architecture

## Techniques
* Orthogonalization
* Single number evaluation metric
* Satisficing and optimizing metric
* Set your dev/test set to be big enough to give high confidence in the overall performance of your system
